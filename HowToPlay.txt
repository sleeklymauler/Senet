Senet is a two player game. In order to win, you must move all of your pieces (7) off the board. 

The senet board consists of 30 spaces, arrange in 3 rows, 10 columns each. The spaces are numbered 0 - 29, and the path the pieces take around
the board is a reverse 's' shape. The first 14 spaces are filled with alternating black and white pieces.

White goes first.

On your turn, you will toss sticks to determine the number of places you can move a pawn, and then choose which pawn you want to move.

Tangent: "Tossing sticks" is akin to rolling dice. There are 4 sticks, each with a black side and a white side. The number of sticks that have the 
white side facing upward after a toss determines how many places you get to move your pawn. 1 white side up is 1; 2 up is 2; 3 up is 3;
4 up is 4; and 0 up (all black sides up) is 5. The program will show the stick colors after every roll as well as the corresponding number of
spaces you can move.

Players can't split up their roll between different pawns.

Only one pawn is allowed per space. You can't move a pawn to a space that already has one of your pawns on it. You can land on spaces that have
enemy pawns on them, in which case those pawns will swap places.

Pawns are moved off the board by rolling so that they go past space 29, or by using one of the houses (see below.)

You have some tricks at your disposal to prevent your opponent from winning. Having 2 or more of your pawns in adjacent spaces will defend them
from being swapped by enemy pawns. Having 3 or more of your pawns in adjacent spaces will not only defend them, but also create a blockade that
enemy pawns won't be able to move through. Defenses can wrap around corners/the ends of the board, but blockades can't.

If for some reason there are no possible moves for what you rolled, you must pick a pawn to move backwards to the nearest empty space.

There are 7 special spaces, called "houses" on the board. 
Space 14 is "The House of Rebirth." Pawns on this space are automatically protected from enemy pawn-swapping.
Space 25 is "The House of Happiness." Your pawns must land on this space exactly before they can continue any further on the board.
Space 26 is "The House of Water." Landing here will send your pawn back to The House of Rebirth (space 14) or to the closest empty space behind it
if The House of Rebirth is already occupied.
Space 27 is "The House of Three Truths." Pawns on this space can only exit with a roll of 3, upon which the pawn is moved off the board.
Space 28 is "The House of Re-Atoum." Pawns move off of this space based on a probability associated with their roll. A roll of 1 gives a 10% chance;
2, 20%; 3, 30%; 4, 40% and 5, 50%. Pawns move off the board once they exit this space.
