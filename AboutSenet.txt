Senet is a board game from Ancient Egypt, with its earliest form having existed around 2600 B.C. 

The game of Senet is found within the Book of the Dead, which was used to help guide the soul to the afterlife after someone died.
Senet is believed to be a representation of the soul as it journeys throught the underworld to the afterlife.

The rules of Senet have been lost to time. Reconstructing the rules has been difficult as it is believed the game changed and evolved over the
course of Egyptian civilization (which was around for quite a long time.) However, historians have reconstructed different rulesets of the game 
based on their own findings. The core concept of the game, moving pieces off of the board in order to win, is found in all rulesets. 
Differences between rulesets include the number of pieces used, the manner that pieces can be moved off the board, and the inclusion/exclusion 
of special spaces on the board.

The rules used in this Senet program are based on the rules made by archaelogist and Egyptologist Gustave JÃ©quier, with some modifications made
in order to meet the requirements of this project.

You can find the rules for this version in the "How to play" section of the main menu.
